## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 0aa21ef: Fix translations not working in production and preview modes.

  In production, `i18next` is a shared singleton loaded from CDN via import map. Each parcel was calling `i18n.init()` independently, but i18next ignores subsequent `init()` calls once already initialized — causing the first parcel to win and others to lose their translations.

  **Architecture changes:**
  - Container now owns the i18next `init()` call (with `LanguageDetector`, `initReactI18next`, and the `lufa:lang-change` event listener)
  - Each parcel registers its own translations via `addResourceBundle()` instead of `init()`
  - Each parcel uses a dedicated i18next namespace (`header-bar`, `landing-page`, `professional-experience`) to avoid key collisions
  - Fallback `init()` is preserved in each parcel for dev mode, where each Vite dev server has its own i18next instance

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 5bb40da: Create header-bar parcel: global navigation bar with NavBar (animated underline links, CSS Grid centering, mobile hamburger menu), ThemeSelector (11 themes managed via the design system `useTheme` hook — no custom event emitted), LangSwitcher (FR/EN), and a separator between controls. LangSwitcher dispatches a `lufa:lang-change` custom event for cross-parcel language synchronisation.
