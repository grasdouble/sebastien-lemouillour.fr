        After my first experience, I entered at Steria as software ingeneer in

        Steria (now named Sopra/Steria) is an IT Services company where i worked
        for projects of the French Ministry of the Interior and Enedis
        (management company of the public electricity distribution network).

      </Typography>

        During this time, I had the opportunity to learn more about the project
        management by firstly leading some subjects and, later, part of the team
        activities. I also worked closely with the customers to collect their
        needs and transform that in specification.
