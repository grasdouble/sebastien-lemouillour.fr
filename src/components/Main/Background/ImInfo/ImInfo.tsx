        The story start here with ImInfo. I initially did my end-of-studies
        internship in this company and had the opportunity to start my real
        working experience as software developer.

        ImInfo was a company who work specifically on projects â€‹in Java and
        offered multiple trainings around this language.

        This work started in 2007 and finished in 2009 and, during this time, I
        confirmed what i learned during my study by working on different
        projects in Java and contribute on multiple training support.
