# Dependabot Configuration

This document explains the Dependabot configuration for the Lufa monorepo and how it helps maintain up-to-date dependencies across all packages.

## Overview

Dependabot is configured to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates in two areas:

- **npm/pnpm dependencies** across all workspace packages
- **GitHub Actions** used in CI/CD workflows

The configuration optimizes for minimal noise by grouping related updates together, reducing the number of PRs from potentially dozens to just a handful per week.

## Configuration Details

### npm Dependencies

**Schedule**: Weekly on Mondays at 9:00 AM (Europe/Paris timezone)

Dependabot scans the entire monorepo from the root directory, automatically detecting all pnpm workspace packages. Updates are grouped into two categories:

#### Development Dependencies

- Groups all `devDependencies` updates (minor and patch versions)
- Includes tools like TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest, Storybook, etc.
- Creates a single PR for all development dependency updates

#### Production Dependencies

- Groups all `dependencies` updates (minor and patch versions)
- Includes React, Single-SPA, and other runtime dependencies
- Creates a single PR for all production dependency updates

**Major version updates** are kept separate to allow for more careful review and testing.

> [!NOTE]
> The versioning strategy is set to `increase`, which is the recommended approach for pnpm workspaces to ensure consistent version resolution.

### GitHub Actions

**Schedule**: Weekly on Mondays at 9:00 AM (Europe/Paris timezone)

All GitHub Actions updates are grouped together to simplify review and merging. This includes updates to:

- `actions/checkout`
- `actions/setup-node`
- `pnpm/action-setup`
- `changesets/action`
- Custom actions used in workflows

**PR Limit**: Maximum 5 open PRs at a time to avoid overwhelming the review queue.

## Pull Request Details

Each Dependabot PR includes:

- **Conventional commit prefix**: `chore(deps)` for npm or `chore(ci)` for GitHub Actions
- **Labels**: Automatically tagged with `dependencies`, `automated`, and `ci/cd` (for Actions)
- **Changelog**: Links to release notes and commits between versions
- **Compatibility score**: GitHub's assessment of the update risk

## Handling Dependabot PRs

### Review Process

1. **Check the CI status** - Ensure all tests pass
2. **Review the changelog** - Understand what changed in the update
3. **Look for breaking changes** - Especially for major version updates
4. **Test locally if needed** - For significant updates, pull the branch and test

### Merging Strategy

**Grouped minor/patch updates** can typically be merged quickly if CI passes:

```bash
# Merge the PR through GitHub UI or:
gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --auto
```

**Major version updates** should be reviewed more carefully:

- Read the migration guide if available
- Test the changes locally
- Consider creating a separate branch for testing
- Update code if breaking changes are present

### Disabling Specific Updates

If you need to prevent Dependabot from updating a specific dependency, add an `ignore` configuration:

```yaml
- package-ecosystem: 'npm'
  directory: '/'
  ignore:
    - dependency-name: 'specific-package'
      versions: ['5.x'] # Ignore version 5.x
```

## Configuration Customization

### Adjusting the Schedule

To change the update frequency or timing, modify the `schedule` section:

```yaml
schedule:
  interval: 'daily' # Options: daily, weekly, monthly
  day: 'wednesday' # For weekly: monday-sunday
  time: '14:00' # 24-hour format
  timezone: 'Europe/Paris'
```

### Adding More Ecosystems

Lufa currently only uses npm and GitHub Actions, but you can add other ecosystems if needed:

```yaml
# Example: Docker
- package-ecosystem: 'docker'
  directory: '/'
  schedule:
    interval: 'weekly'
```

### Customizing PR Limits

Adjust the `open-pull-requests-limit` to control how many PRs can be open simultaneously:

```yaml
open-pull-requests-limit: 5 # Default is 5, max is 10
```

## Best Practices

### Regular Maintenance

- **Review weekly**: Don't let Dependabot PRs pile up
- **Merge promptly**: Security updates should be merged as soon as possible
- **Test thoroughly**: Run the full test suite before merging grouped updates
- **Monitor changelog**: Stay informed about changes in your dependencies

### Security Updates

Dependabot automatically creates PRs for security vulnerabilities. These PRs:

- Are marked with a security label
- Should be prioritized over regular updates
- Often include details about the vulnerability (CVE)
- May bypass PR limits in critical cases

> [!WARNING]
> Security updates should be merged as soon as possible after verifying they don't break functionality.

### Dealing with Conflicts

If a Dependabot PR has merge conflicts:

1. Dependabot will attempt to rebase automatically
2. If it can't, you'll see a comment asking you to resolve conflicts
3. Use the "Resolve conflicts" button in GitHub UI, or:
   ```bash
   gh pr checkout <pr-number>
   git rebase main
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

## Monitoring and Metrics

GitHub provides insights into Dependabot activity:

- **Security alerts**: View in the Security tab
- **Dependency graph**: See all dependencies and their relationships
- **Update history**: Track which updates were applied and when

## Troubleshooting

### Dependabot Not Creating PRs

**Check if Dependabot is enabled**:

1. Go to repository Settings → Code security and analysis
2. Ensure "Dependabot version updates" is enabled

**Verify the configuration**:

```bash
# Validate the YAML syntax
yamllint .github/dependabot.yml
```

### PRs Failing CI

If Dependabot PRs consistently fail CI:

1. Check if the dependency has known issues in the version
2. Review the error logs to identify the problem
3. Consider opening an issue with the dependency maintainer
4. Temporarily ignore the update if it's blocking

### Too Many PRs

If you're getting overwhelmed with PRs:

1. Increase grouping to include more update types
2. Reduce the update frequency (e.g., from weekly to monthly)
3. Adjust `open-pull-requests-limit` to a lower number
4. Consider ignoring non-critical dependencies
