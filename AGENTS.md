# ⚠️ Agent — Read this entire file before acting

These rules apply to every session, including after a compact or checkpoint. Before making any change, verify you have internalized all sections below. Never add a rule without first checking it doesn't already exist.

# Shared Agent Rules — Grasdouble Ecosystem

These rules apply to **every repo** in the Grasdouble ecosystem. They are maintained in `@grasdouble/lufa_config_agents` and referenced from each repo's `AGENTS.md`.

After reading this file, read the repo-specific `AGENTS.md` for rules that apply only to the current repository.

## Self-improvement — Update AGENTS.md when a mistake is identified

When the user points out a mistake or a recurring problem, **always update the repo's `AGENTS.md`** to prevent it from happening again — in the same response, before moving on.

- Identify the root cause, not just the symptom
- Write a rule specific enough to prevent the exact mistake
- Do not add vague rules ("be careful with X") — write actionable rules with ✅/❌ examples
- Check that a similar rule doesn't already exist before adding

**Rule template:**

```markdown
## Rule title — short imperative

One sentence explaining why this matters.

- ✅ Correct example
- ❌ Wrong example (with consequence if useful)
```

This applies to any type of mistake: tooling, workflow, code quality, file management, etc.

**✅ Update AGENTS.md when:**

- The user explicitly asks to add or change a rule
- A recurring mistake is identified (same error happened twice or more)
- A new validated pattern emerges that applies to any future session in this repo

**❌ Do NOT update AGENTS.md when:**

- The instruction is session-specific ("for this task, skip lint")
- The user qualified it with "for now", "just this time", "temporarily"
- The fact is already captured by a stored memory
- The rule would duplicate or contradict an existing section

**Agent memories vs AGENTS.md:**

- Use your agent's memory system (if available) for facts that could apply across multiple repos (user preferences, general conventions)
- Use AGENTS.md for rules that are **specific to this repo** (tooling, architecture, workflow)
- Use this shared file for rules that apply across **all** Grasdouble repos
- When in doubt: if it references a specific file, command, or package in this repo → AGENTS.md

---

## Critical thinking — Always challenge requests

Before implementing anything, evaluate the request critically:

- If the approach has flaws, better alternatives, or architectural concerns, **say so first** before executing
- Don't just implement what is asked — ask yourself if it's the right solution
- If you disagree, explain why clearly and propose an alternative
- Only proceed once the approach is validated (either confirmed by the user or after proposing a better option)

**Non-trivial = anything involving:** architecture decisions, API design, technology or library choices, naming that will be hard to change, security-sensitive code, or changes that affect more than one package.

- ✅ "You asked to add Redux here, but the app already uses Zustand — should I use Zustand instead for consistency?"
- ✅ "Splitting this into two components makes sense, but it will require changing the parent interface — is that acceptable?"
- ❌ Silently implementing a pattern that conflicts with the existing codebase
- ❌ Asking for validation on every trivial decision (adding a CSS class, fixing a typo)

---

## Git — No commits, no staging, no destructive operations

Never create git commits and never stage files. Leave all git operations to the user. **This rule also applies to any sub-agent or background agent you launch — always instruct sub-agents explicitly to never run `git commit` or `git add`.**

- ✅ `git diff`, `git status`, `git log`, `git stash`
- ❌ `git add` — never; staging is the user's responsibility
- ❌ `git commit` — never, even when asked to "save" or "apply" changes
- ❌ Launching a sub-agent without explicitly telling it "never run git commit or git add"
- ❌ `git rebase` — rewrites history
- ❌ `git reset --hard` — destroys uncommitted work
- ❌ `git push --force` / `git push --force-with-lease` — overwrites remote
- ❌ `git clean -fd` — permanently deletes untracked files

---

## Package Manager — Always use pnpm

This repo uses **pnpm** exclusively. Never use `npm` or `yarn`.

- ✅ `pnpm install`, `pnpm add <pkg>`, `pnpm run <script>`, `pnpm dlx <cmd>`
- ❌ `npm install`, `yarn add`
- ❌ `npx <cmd>` — bypasses pnpm, can silently pull packages from the npm registry; use `pnpm dlx` instead

---

## RTK — Token-Optimized CLI

**rtk** is a CLI proxy that filters and compresses command outputs, saving 60-90% tokens.

### Rule

Always prefix **bash/shell** commands with `rtk` (not tool calls like `ide-get_diagnostics`):

```bash
# Instead of:              Use:
git status                 rtk git status
git log -10                rtk git log -10
pnpm lint                  rtk pnpm lint
pnpm build                 rtk pnpm build
```

### Native rtk commands (run as-is, no prefix needed)

```bash
rtk gain              # Token savings dashboard
rtk gain --history    # Per-command savings history
rtk discover          # Find missed rtk opportunities
rtk proxy <cmd>       # Run raw (no filtering) but track usage
```

---

## TypeScript — Never call `tsc` directly

The `tsconfig` files in Grasdouble repos have `declaration: true` and `sourceMap: true`. **Running `tsc` without `--noEmit` emits `.js`, `.d.ts`, and `.map` files into `src/`. Always use the project scripts which set the correct flags.**

### Allowed — type checking

- ✅ `ide-get_diagnostics` tool — preferred, zero risk of file emission
- ✅ `pnpm typecheck` from a specific package folder
- ✅ `pnpm all:typecheck` from the root (runs all packages)

### Forbidden — always

- ❌ `tsc` — direct binary call
- ❌ `pnpm tsc` — still calls the binary directly, bypasses the script
- ❌ `tsc -p tsconfig.json` with any flags, including `--noEmit` or `--listEmittedFiles`

If stray generated files appear in `src/` (`.js`, `.js.map`, `.d.ts`, `.d.ts.map`), delete them immediately.

---

## Lint & Type Errors — Fix the root cause, don't disable rules

When ESLint or TypeScript reports errors, always investigate and fix the root cause rather than disabling rules.

**Common root causes:**

- **"File ignored" / "no matching configuration"** → Check `eslint.config.mjs` has proper file patterns and parser configuration
- **`@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-*` errors** → Usually means TypeScript types are missing, not that code is unsafe
  - ✅ Install missing `@types/*` packages (e.g., `@types/react`, `@types/node`)
  - ✅ Verify `tsconfig.json` extends the right base config (`react-app.json` for React projects, `node.json` for Node)
  - ❌ Never disable `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-*` rules without first checking if types are properly installed
- **"Could not find declaration file for module"** → Missing `@types/*` package or missing `typescript` itself

**Process:**

1. Read the error message carefully — it often tells you exactly what's missing
2. Check if required dependencies are installed (`@types/*`, `typescript`, parser packages)
3. Verify configuration files (`tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`) are correct for the project type
4. Only disable a rule if the code is genuinely correct and the rule doesn't apply (document why in a comment)

- ✅ `pnpm add -D @types/react @types/react-dom typescript` when TypeScript can't resolve React types
- ✅ Change `extends: ["@grasdouble/lufa_config_tsconfig/react-app.json"]` when working with React
- ❌ `'@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment': 'off'` without investigating why TypeScript sees the value as `any`

---

## Workflow — No planning files in the repository

Never create markdown files in the repository for planning, notes, or tracking.

- ✅ Use in-memory notes, session workspace files (e.g. `~/.copilot/session-state/*/plan.md`)
- ❌ `PLAN.md`, `TODO.md`, `NOTES.md`, or any tracking file committed to the repo
- ❌ Creating a markdown file "temporarily" — even temporary files pollute git history

This applies to sub-agents you launch: always instruct them not to create planning files in the repo.

---

## Accessibility — Non-negotiable

Every UI change must consider accessibility. This is not optional and must never be skipped during review or implementation.

Checklist to apply systematically:

- **Decorative elements** (svg, images without meaning) → `aria-hidden="true"`
- **Interactive elements** → keyboard accessible, `role` and `aria-*` attributes correct
- **Images** → `alt` attribute always present (empty string `""` if decorative)
- **Form fields** → associated `<label>` or `aria-label`
- **Color** → never the only means of conveying information
- **Focus** → visible focus indicator, logical tab order
- **Animations** → always respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — pause or skip any motion when active
- **Contrast** → WCAG AA minimum: 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text and UI components
- **Semantic HTML** → use the right element first (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`…) before reaching for ARIA roles
- **Heading hierarchy** → logical `h1 → h2 → h3` structure, never skip levels
- **Live regions** → use `aria-live` for content that updates dynamically without a page reload

When writing or reviewing code, if an accessibility issue is found, fix it in the same task — never defer it.

---

## TDD — Test before code

When modifying existing code or implementing new behavior, always follow the **Red → Green → Refactor** cycle:

1. **Red** — Write or update the test first, run it, confirm it fails for the right reason
2. **Green** — Write the minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor** — Clean up, then re-run tests to confirm they still pass

**Rules:**

- ✅ Write or update the failing test **before** changing the production code
- ✅ When a code change makes an existing test fail, update the test **before** running the code change — or update both together and confirm the test fails for the right reason first
- ✅ Run the affected test suite after every step (`pnpm test` in the package folder)
- ❌ Never write code first and tests after — the test must define expected behavior, not describe existing code
- ❌ Never leave tests broken and move on — all tests must pass before the task is considered done
- ❌ Never delete a test to make a suite pass — update it to match the new expected behavior, or justify removal explicitly

**What counts as "a change":**

- Modifying a component's rendered output (elements, attributes, text)
- Changing a function's signature or return value
- Adding, removing, or renaming props
- Changing accessibility attributes (aria, role, alt…)

**Exception:** When adding a brand-new feature with no existing test, write the test file first (even if it just has a skeleton), then implement.

---

## Changesets — Naming and content

When creating a changeset file manually in `.changeset/`, always use a **descriptive kebab-case name** — never a random hex ID.

- ✅ `.changeset/add-hero-animation.md`
- ✅ `.changeset/happy-lions-sing.md` (auto-generated by the CLI — acceptable)
- ❌ `.changeset/6197e9-63944d-6768e0.md`

**Content rules:**

- Always check `rtk git diff main --name-only` first to identify **all** changed packages before writing changesets (assumes `main` is the default branch — adjust if different)
- **Every package with changed files must be covered** — no exception, including private packages (`"private": true`), tests, storybook, docs…
  - ✅ All packages with file changes → changeset entry required
  - ❌ Never skip a package, regardless of its `private` field or purpose
- **Exception: the root `package.json` of a monorepo** — it is not a workspace package and does not need a changeset entry (changes to it, e.g. root devDependencies, are not tracked by changesets)
- Use `patch` for fixes/refactors, `minor` for new user-visible features, `major` for breaking changes
- **Always prefix the description** with a conventional commit type: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `test:`
- **Always verify** the changeset after creation: `rtk pnpm changeset status`

**Consolidate before creating** — always check for existing changesets first:

Before creating a new changeset, run:

```bash
rtk git status --short .changeset/   # untracked / staged files
rtk git diff main --name-only -- .changeset/  # committed but not merged
```

- ✅ If an existing changeset targets the **exact same set of packages** you modified → **add your description to it** (same bump type or escalate)
- ✅ If an existing changeset covers some of your packages but also covers **packages you did not modify** → **create a new file** covering only the packages you changed
- ✅ Create a new file only when no existing changeset covers the package
- ❌ Never create a second changeset for the same package in the same branch

**Atomic vs independent — choose the right grouping:**

When multiple packages change together, decide before creating any file:

- ✅ **One shared file** when all packages changed as part of the **same atomic feature or fix** (e.g. a new component + its tests + its stories)
- ✅ **One file per package** when packages changed for **unrelated reasons** in the same branch
- ❌ One file per package when the changes are atomic — this creates unnecessary noise and splits a single story across multiple entries
- ❌ One shared file listing packages with unrelated changes — misleads readers about what changed and why

Prefix guide:

- `feat:` — new user-visible feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `chore:` — maintenance, config, tooling, dependency update
- `refactor:` — code restructuring without behavior change
- `perf:` — performance improvement
- `docs:` — documentation only
- `style:` — visual/CSS change with no logic change
- `test:` — test additions or changes

## Build & Validation

Run these commands to validate your changes before presenting them to the user. **Always prefix commands with `rtk`** (e.g. `rtk pnpm all:lint`).

| Scope                      | Command              | From           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| All packages — lint        | `pnpm all:lint`      | root           |
| All packages — build       | `pnpm all:build`     | root           |
| All packages — typecheck   | `pnpm all:typecheck` | root           |
| Single package — lint      | `pnpm lint`          | package folder |
| Single package — build     | `pnpm build`         | package folder |
| Single package — typecheck | `pnpm typecheck`     | package folder |

**Which scope to use:**

- Changed only one package → run package-level commands first (faster)
- Changed shared code (DS tokens, container, config) → run root-level commands
- Unsure → run root-level to be safe

**On failure:** Stop. Fix the error. Re-run the failing command. Do not stage with `git add` or report to the user until the relevant commands pass. Never edit generated files (`dist/`, `node_modules/`, `.pnpm-store/`, `*.map`, `*.d.ts` in build output) to work around a failure.

> The repo is a monorepo. Explore `packages/` to discover available packages — never assume their paths.

---

## Parcels — No dynamic imports

Parcel bundles are distributed via CDN as single files. Dynamic imports (`await import()`) cause Vite to create separate chunks, which are not deployed to the CDN and result in 404 errors in production.

**Rule:** Always use static imports in parcels. If a dependency is needed, import it at the top of the file.

- ✅ `import { CreateMLCEngine } from '@mlc-ai/web-llm';` — static import, bundled in the parcel
- ❌ `await import('@mlc-ai/web-llm')` — creates a separate chunk that won't be on the CDN
- ❌ `const module = await import('./utils')` — same issue, even for internal modules

**Why this matters:**

- Vite 8 removed support for `inlineDynamicImports` (deprecated)
- CDN deployment copies only the main bundle file, not auto-generated chunks
- Dynamic imports in parcels always fail in production with 404 errors

**Exceptions:** None for parcels. If you need lazy loading, refactor the architecture or use route-based code splitting at the container level.

---

## Test files — Colocalize in `__tests__` at the same level as source

All test files must be placed in a `__tests__` folder **at the same directory level as the file being tested**, not in a central location.

- ✅ `src/components/Button/Button.tsx` → `src/components/Button/__tests__/Button.test.tsx`
- ✅ `src/utils/format.ts` → `src/utils/__tests__/format.test.ts`
- ✅ `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` → `src/hooks/__tests__/useAuth.test.ts`
- ❌ `src/components/Button/Button.tsx` → `src/__tests__/Button.test.tsx` — wrong, centralizes tests
- ❌ `src/components/Button/Button.tsx` → `src/components/Button/Button.test.tsx` — wrong, not in `__tests__` folder

**Why this matters:**

- Makes it easy to find tests for any file (look in the same directory)
- Scales well as the project grows
- Follows common JavaScript/TypeScript conventions (Jest, Vitest, etc.)
- Reduces mental overhead when adding new tests

---

## `index.ts` files — Barrels only, never logic

`src/**/index.ts` files are globally excluded from coverage in the shared Vitest config. This means any logic placed in an `index.ts` will be silently invisible to coverage.

- ✅ `index.ts` files must only contain re-export statements (`export { X } from './X'`)
- ❌ Never put functions, classes, constants, or any runtime logic in an `index.ts`
- ❌ If you see logic in an `index.ts`, move it to a dedicated file and re-export it

---

## Design System — Prefer components over custom CSS

Always use Lufa Design System components before writing custom CSS. Use the `lufa-design-system` skill to discover the current list of available components and their props.

Only write custom CSS for things the DS genuinely cannot do:

- `min-height`, `aspect-ratio`, or other structural constraints
- Responsive `auto-fit` / `auto-fill` grid layouts
- Element-level styles (e.g. `img` sizing)
- Design token values not exposed via component props (e.g. `border-top` with a token)

---

## i18n — Trans component and namespace

When a translation string contains inline JSX (links, `<strong>`, etc.), always use `<Trans>` instead of splitting into multiple keys.

- ✅ One key with `<Trans t={t} i18nKey="..." components={{...}} />` — translators see the full sentence
- ❌ `key_prefix` / `key_middle` / `key_suffix` — fragments that break translation context

Always pass `t={t}` (from `useTranslation`) to `<Trans>` so it inherits the namespace automatically — **never hardcode `ns="..."`** on `<Trans>`.

- ✅ `<Trans i18nKey="section.myKey" t={t} components={{...}} />`
- ❌ `<Trans i18nKey="section.myKey" ns="landing-page" components={{...}} />`

> Rationale: in production, i18next is a shared singleton initialized by the container. Setting `defaultNS` in the parcel's local config has no effect in production. Passing `t` is the only reliable way to propagate the namespace.

---

## Changesets — Repo-specific examples

> The naming convention, content rules, and prefix guide are in the shared rules. The following examples are specific to this repo's package names.

One changeset per package — with examples:

```md
# .changeset/add-hero-image.md ← only touches landing-page

---

'@grasdouble/slm_parcel_landing-page': minor

---

feat: replace hero logo with diorama image.
```

```md
# .changeset/update-shared-component.md ← atomic change spanning two parcels

---

'@grasdouble/slm_parcel_header-bar': minor
'@grasdouble/slm_parcel_landing-page': patch

---

feat: add new shared component and consume it in landing-page.
```

- ❌ One file for a refactor that touches N packages independently — create N files instead
